# Here's my notes / quick review on the latest reading

    I really enjoyed reviewing the Text and Introducing CSS. The more I go over these tools the more it seems to click. It's been great to see how all of this comes together. 

    Being able to understand the importance of <link>ing properly and always making sure all your pages are connected. (css, html, js).
     

    ie. 
        <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />

    The Javascript review was really helpful. I got a better understanding of variables and a bit more of a comprehensive look at so many things that variables can do! Below are a few notes to help keep things clear for me.

    Variables: 
        var = 
        const = 
        let =

    Arrays: [ ]
    String ('', " ")
    Boolean (true / false statements)    
    Arithmatic: (math functions ie. + , - , / , % , etc.)

* the if / else statements are still a thing I'm slowly taking in, but the more I review, the more I understand.
